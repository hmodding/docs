# How to install RaftModLoader

Let's get started with the first step!

### 1. Downloading the Launcher

First, download the latest version of our launcher [here](https://www.raftmodding.com/download). Then place it where ever you want, but we recommend you keep it on your desktop, or somewhere easy to use.

### 2. Terms of Service

Start the launcher by opening the file you downloaded. On first launch you will be prompted to accept our Terms of Service, which is necessary for using our software. By pressing "Agree", you confirm that you accept them. If you have any questions regarding you data privacy, please feel free to contact us via [Discord](https://raftmodding.com/discord) or via [E-Mail](https://www.raftmodding.com/contact).

### 3. Installation

After accepting the terms of service the launcher will download and install all the required files as shown below. You don't need to do anything here, just wait. It can be pretty fast as its less than 5 MB.
