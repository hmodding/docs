# Reading private variables

Reading private variables is clearly necessary when modding raft. Let's see how easy it is!

To access private variables we need to use **Harmony**. You can visit the Harmony wiki by clicking [here](https://harmony.pardeike.net/).  
_`Harmony is a library for patching, replacing and decorating .NET and Mono methods during runtime.`_

To get Visual Studio autocomplete to work you need to install the Nuget package Lib.Harmony version 2. Then, to use harmony you simply need to add the `HarmonyLib` namespace by adding `using HarmonyLib;` at the top of your class. You don't need to install the nuget package for Raft to compile the code, but it makes developing easier.

To access a **non-static private variable** you use Traverse.Create\(\) with the object instance and .Field\(\) with the field name.

```csharp
string myvalue = Traverse.Create(ScriptInstance).Field("fieldname").GetValue() as string;

// For example to get the value "stats" of the class Network_Player we can do that :
PlayerStats stats = Traverse.Create(RAPI.getLocalPlayer()).Field("stats").GetValue() as PlayerStats;
```

To access a **static private variable** you also use Traverse.Create\(\) but with the class type and .Field\(\) with the field name.

```csharp
string myvalue = Traverse.Create(typeof(classname)).Field("fieldname").GetValue() as string;

// For example to get the value "allAvailableItems" of the class ItemManager we can do that :
List<Item_Base> allAvailableItems = Traverse.Create(typeof(ItemManager)).Field("allAvailableItems").GetValue() as List<Item_Base>;
```
