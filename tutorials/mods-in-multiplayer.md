# Mods in multiplayer

You've already found out how to [install mods](https://api.raftmodding.com/tutorials/how-to-install-a-mod) and have maybe had fun playing with mods alone. But of course, playing games is better together and you might ask yourself how to play modded Raft together with your friends.

### First things first: General rule

In a modded game, make sure that **all players inside a multiplayer game have the mod loader and the same mods installed**.

Some mods might work for individual players but others might break the world or crash the game if they are not installed for all players!

### Which mods work in multiplayer?

To our knowledge, basically all mods should usually work in multiplayer. To be sure, you can review the mod's page in our [mods directory](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods).

### Further questions

If you have further questions, you can ask us anything on our [Discord server](https://www.raftmodding.com/discord).
